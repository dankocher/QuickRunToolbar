# Quick Run Toolbar

Quick Run Toolbar puts your favorite Run/Debug configurations right on the Main Toolbar as clickable buttons — one click to run, zero context switching.

## Features
- Buttons on the Main Toolbar (New UI and Classic UI).
- Pick which Run/Debug configurations appear.
- Reorder buttons with drag & drop.
- Custom icon per button (SVG/PNG), light/dark aware.
- Optional text label per button (show/hide).
- Enable/disable per button without removing the configuration.
- Per‑project settings; non‑destructive (doesn’t modify your Run/Debug configurations).
- Works with any Run/Debug configuration type.
- Built‑in icon picker with search + “Choose from file…” support.

## Installation
- From the IDE:
  1. Open Settings/Preferences > Plugins.
  2. Search for “QuickRun” in the Marketplace, or choose “Install Plugin from Disk…” if you have a ZIP.
  3. Restart the IDE when prompted.

- Manual from sources:
  - Run the plugin in a sandbox IDE:
    - `./gradlew runIde`
  - Build a distributable ZIP:
    - `./gradlew buildPlugin` (the ZIP is placed under `build/distributions/`)

## Usage

### Show buttons on the Main Toolbar
After installation and restart, QuickRun appears on the right side of the Main Toolbar. Each button represents a Run/Debug configuration you selected.

- Click a button to run the associated configuration.
- If a label is enabled, it is shown next to the icon; otherwise the button is icon‑only.

### Configure which buttons are shown
Use the dedicated editor to select, order, and customize your buttons:

- Open Tools > Quick Run: Edit Buttons
  - Tip: You can also use “Find Action” (Ctrl+Shift+A on Windows/Linux, Cmd+Shift+A on macOS) and search for “Quick Run: Edit Buttons”.

In the editor dialog:
- Reorder rows using the drag handle to change button order.
- Click the Icon cell to choose a custom icon for the button.
- Edit the Name cell to override the display label (optional).
- Toggle “Show Name” to show/hide the text label on the toolbar.
- Toggle “Enabled” to show/hide the button on the toolbar.

Press OK to save. The Main Toolbar updates accordingly.

### Notes
- Only existing, non‑temporary Run/Debug configurations are listed for selection.
- If a configuration is removed from the project, its button will automatically disappear.
- If you do not see the toolbar, ensure the Main Toolbar is visible (View > Appearance > Toolbar).
